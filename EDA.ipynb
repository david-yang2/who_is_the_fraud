       " ' the lambrettas   the lambrettas came into being in the late 70s. doug sanders and jez bird were playing in a band called shakedown (who are still going strong today). they were looking for direction in keeping with their musical tastes, so split from shakedown to start something new.  both could sing and play guitar and set about writing. they were soon joined by like minded drummer paul wincerand bassist mark ellis. doug says: “there were only a few mods locally in brighton and hastings and we had no idea there would be a revival on the scale that it grew into. that’s when we decided to call the band the lambrettas to make it as obvious as possible, so that people would know what we were about.” they suffered some criticism later on for their name but these were early days. they always maintained (and still do), that a band should be judged on their music first and foremost.  they soon realised there were other bands around like their neighbours the teenbeats from hastings, who are also still around and played with the lambrettas at the 100 club in london in 2009, as they did in 1979 at london’s dublin castle.  their first gig was on hastings pier with 4 other bands, and promoter peter haines offered them management. after a few months of gigs they were signed to elton john’s rocket records and released their first single go steady. this got them some airplay and soon they were gigging more regularly. the mod revival had now grown, and clothes that they used to fight for in the charity shops were now on sale in the high street. their second single was poison ivy, the song they are most remembered for, as it spent a long time in the charts. soon after, their album beat boys in the jet age was released and also spent several months in the charts. this review was on amazon 5.0 out of 5 stars cracking tunes from pop geniuses, 18 jan 2002 by a customer this review is from: beat boys in the jet age when the nme writers got together in 1989 to list their top 100 of the albums of the 1980\\'s-who would have thought a \"79 mod band would be in there alongside u2 and bruce springsteen?beat boys in the jet age is one of the best pop albums ever made, with one of the most imaginative sleeves. the lambrettas would have worked on any audience, they didn’t need the mod credentials as a crutch.what a bonus we mods got them as our band.  third single was da a ance which coincided with uk and european tours. a full discography is on the website. www.thelambrettas.co.uk                                                        the universal as sharp musically as they are in attire, liverpool quartet the universal apply timeless values of upbeat melodic british rock songwriting to a sharp-dressed 2012 model.  the band are based around singer, guitarist and songwriter terry shaughnessy, who brings a deep-seated love of classic vintage guitar rock. growing up in liverpool, the ambience of the beatles was a happily accepted ever-present, but with two uncles playing in bands and a mother an active member of the small faces fan club, shaughnessy\\'s musical education came steeped in classic values of songs with creativity, individuality and fire in the belly. the universal  are completed with gary chambers on bass, dave ormsby on drums and lead guitarist piet koehorst.  with their passionate, driving musical vision, an acute fashion-sense and shaughnessy\\'s motto of \\'musician minus ego plus fire\\', the universal are set to make 2012 their own.  www.facebook.com/theuniversalband www.reverbnation.com/theuniversaluk www.twitter.com/universalbanduk       ',\n",

       " 'gridspectives: future and aesthetics of the energiewende everybody loves bridges. most people hate grids. why? times are changing\\u2028 we are amidst a profound transformation. the digitalisation manifesting itself in the world wide web of information has not just changed the way we work and live, but also the way we perceive, feel and think. our world has altered dramatically during the past 20 years due to new means of communication. remember? how did it look and feel 20 years ago without internet, mail and smartphone?  as the fossil era is coming to an end, new ways use renewable energies to power our daily lives (more or less) directly has a similarly influential potential to transform our way of life. the next industrial revolution will be powered by renewables. the upcoming pan-european web of energy – some call it already the supersmart grid – will combine up-to-date communication technologies with an upgraded grid infrastructure. what should it look and feel like?  perceptions are changing \\u2028europe’s electricity grid was mainly built over 50 years ago. at times of general enthusiasm about industrial development, they signified progress and comfort. engineers spread steel lattice pylons all over the landscape. they were the robust, functional and cheap solution at that time. nowadays, power lines have a strong negative connotation amongst the general public. they are associated with heavy pollution resulting from energy giants’ pursuit of profit regardless of environmental and health consequences. new power line projects nurture strong public opposition, leading to long delays in planning procedures. renewables lead into a new era bringing power closer to the people. energy becomes more democratic. more and more individuals, companies, communities, cities and regions will produce, consume, store, trade and manage energy over the planned pan-european energy web – just like user generated content on the internet we will see user generated energy. with this shift in sources, roles and activities individual and collective perceptions change. does the existing grid infrastructure of the fossil era – omnipresent and omni-discussed as industrial lattice pylons – represent the new era of a smart and renewable power system? can remnants of past industrial times become sexy, exciting, desirable messengers of a better renewable future?  driving the energiewende  to avoid the power grid to become the bottleneck for the growth of renewable energies, many kilometres of new overhead lines will need to be installed in the near future. current public acceptance projects focus on rational approaches: they provide transparency by providing background information to increase the general understanding and give room for discussions. however, they do not address a crucial aspect of grid lines: their visual effect. first attempts to explore future pylon designs were undertaken by architects and designers in connection to various pylon design competitions carried out by european transmission system operators. the result: around 500 diverse and innovative pylon design concepts. current grid discussions are either highly technological and bureaucratic or ideologically polarised. to make grids popular, the public debate has to become emotional, exciting, fresh and attractive. grids have to become “my business” instead of “my problem”.  after an exciting panel discussion at the cebit the first gridspectives dialogue forum \"furture and aesthetics of the energiewende\" goes beyond gathering thrilling design proposals. it aims at triggering a constructive and future-oriented dialogue among stakeholders and the broader public, leading to a – why not even enchanting, and – visionary outlook on landscape integration of electricity grids. on 22 april will discuss at the 1st gridspectives dialogue forum in berlin:- how does public perception change ?- why do we dislike grid infrastructure ?- how do designers, architects and landscaper approach grid planning ?- which design options are currently discussed ?- what is happening internationally ?

   no. we have no legitimate competitors at the moment; however, we have heard someone is claiming to offer \"horseback riding tours of anna maria island.\" they are taking people\\'s money and not showing up. horses are not permitted on ami\\'s beaches. we don\\'t know who they are. who can participate in the beach experience?

   yes. your horse will have a halter and a lead-line tied in a loop that you can hold like reins; however, there will not be a bit in the horse\\'s mouth.  how many riders can you accommodate?     we usually bring 8 horses to the beach. if you have 8-16 riders in your party, you can ride in two groups.  if you have at least 8 riders in your party, we can organize a weapons-grade beach party for you. call 941-907-7272 ext. 3 for details.  can a child ride with an adult?

       " '16 acres charts the  rebuilding of ground zero, one of the most architecturally, politically, and emotionally complex urban renewal projects in american history. from the beginning, the effort has been fraught with controversy, delays and politics. the struggle has encompassed eleven years, nineteen government agencies, a dozen projects and over $20 billion. aside from the staggering engineering challenges of the site itself, a major complicating factor in the rebuilding of the world trade center is the sheer number of interested parties. politicians, developers, architects, insurance companies, local residents, and relatives of 9/11 victims all profess a claim to the site and are often in conflict with one another. according to the new york times, \"where some saw lucrative real estate, others saw a graveyard. where some saw rockefeller center or lincoln center or grand central terminal, others saw gettysburg.\" what was once ground zero is now a frenzied construction site. three thousand workers are building four of the tallest skyscrapers in america, an iconic - and complicated - train station, a performing arts center and a sacred memorial and museum. what will emerge in downtown manhattan over the next few years will redefine the city - and the country - for generations. 16 acres is the story of how and why this historic project got built. at the heart of the story is the dramatic tension between noblest intentions, the desire of everyone involved to \"get it right,\" and the politics, hubris, ego and ideology that is the bedrock of new york city. what does it say about us as new yorkers, as americans? as with all great urban projects, from the pyramids to rome\\'s colleseum to rockefeller center, a small group of powerful people will dictate the outcome. with inside access to the project and these key players, 16 acres tells the story behind the headlines. who are these men and women? what motivates them? how will their personalities shape the project? and, ultimately, will it succeed? the film also follows the dramatic rush to complete the memorial in time, and the key players as they prepare to converge on the site for the 10th anniversary.',\n",

your guide to eliminating gluten and losing weight\".  topic: defeat wheat  brian’s love of food began at a very young age, as his parents owned several restaurants and recently celebrated their 26th anniversary in business. he grew up learning to prepare, know, and love not just ordinary food, but great food. in fact, it was this early passion for wholesome cuisine that led him into the retail advertising industry. in 2008, brian, his business partner, and a swiss-born chef (who is a member of the american culinary federation) founded a successful brokerage firm that creates new items for a number of national retailers and shopping clubs. you may have even seen brian on nbc, fox, cbs, abc, and qvc talking about the benefits of adopting an all-natural diet. his advertising tenure has also included working with the following companies: the kroger company, robert mondavi wines, idaho potatoes, hillshire farms, red lobster, sam’s club, and other well known food/beverage brands. sometime over the course of working with these companies, brian was appointed the director of marketing for cedarlane natural foods, the second largest frozen organic food company in the nation. while at the helm of cedarlane, he sold the first “made-with-organic” frozen line that wal-mart ever carried. additionally, he worked one-on-one with dr. barry sears, the author of the new york time’s best selling book the zone diet. the cedarlane team and dr. sears advanced the development and launch of the zone diet frozen meals. these meals adhered to the rigorous standards set forth by dr. barry sears in the zone diet and other books that he has written over the years. brian eventually became the spokesperson for the entire zone diet frozen line, appearing with dr. barry sears on several national and local mediums. today, brian lives in denver, colorado, with his lifelong partner. they have celebrated being together for over sixteen years. they are also the proud owners of two adopted dogs, weimer, a weimaraner, and zoe, a dalmatian.   susan algert, phd, r.d.university of california cooperative extension •  nutrition, family, and consumer sciences advisortopic: understanding the

       " 'there is something inherently beautiful about natural light. it can be soft and warm, or hard and unforgiving, or even have a sort of melancholy to it. these are the areas we will be looking at in this course. fashion and beauty photography make use of natural light in many ways. a recent viewing of vogue (october, 2012) reveals many natural light photography shots by up and coming and well established photographers. the techniques are not hard to understand, but still require the finesse and deliberate approach that is required when using artificial lighting. we will look at natural light from all angles; full sun, modified sun, shade and moody, emotional light. we will build some inexpensive modifiers for natural light, and also show how to correctly use white reflectors, silver and gold reflectors, scrims, mirrors, and more. these tools are not expensive, but the results they give can be astounding. the natural light fashion/beauty photography course is divided into 12 lectures, each running approximately 30 minutes. there is a workbook, plans for building a scrim and large reflector, and lots of videos. most lectures include a shoot with the gear we are using, a photoshop tutorial, the psd file for viewing and a look at how the final images were selected. looking at the images as they are shot, and then edited, is very powerful as a learning tool. if you are interested in portraiture, fashion, beauty or glamour, this natural light photography course will open your eyes to the very cool ways you can use natural light to make your images. the beauty photography course is suited to any level of photographer. i recommend a light meter, although we will also show you ways to use your camera meter as we go. a couple of stands would also be a good addition to your natural light arsenal. this class also has over two hours of bonus content, with new content being added in may 2013 and june 2013.',\n",

       " 'there’s a real and quantifiable difference between a regular dba and the leader of an enterprise.  guiding the database effort of a huge enterprise takes business acumen, experience, problem solving, street-smarts, and above all… vision.  and quite often regular dbas are thrown into big enterprises without knowing what it takes to get the job done.  in fact, most dbas get thrown into this situation without even a hint that there’s a difference.  and while they do the best they can, they tend to do more harm than good which is why many companies have such a hard time managing their data.  what you need is to change your tactic when dealing with large numbers of servers. the biggest piece of missing training in databases is enterprise training.  dbas are often taught syntax and usage of features, but they’re never taught how to actually use them to plan an enterprise, run an enterprise, or cope with changing requirements, manage difficult users or groups, manage growth, manage vendors, etc.  there are so many more requirements to running an enterprise than just knowing how the individual features work.  there are disk and backup requirements, auditing requests, end-user reporting, paranoid vps, and much more.  and there’s no way to gain this type of business sense on your own.  you have to learn from seasoned pros who have been there many times over. i’ve built many successful dba teams in a few companies that were resistant to the change.  and i can show you how to do it too.  take your daily tasks down to almost nothing while you increase your visibility in your company (in a positive way). what you will learn: 1.       how to properly manage a large environment. 2.       managing disk space and growth requirements across hundreds of servers. 3.       manage end user expectations. 4.       build a self-service reporting model to keep dbas from having to field every day requests. 5.       reduce security management issues by up to 90%. 6.       how to assess your biggest dba resource hogs to make the most impact in your environment. 7.       strategies for dealing with vendors and vendor security issues. 8.       how to hire a competent dba. 9.       how to staff your company appropriately.  do you know how many dbas you need? 10.   how to get a bigger raise and make your company pay for training. and much much more.  if you manage an enterprise or would like to then you can’t afford to miss this seminar.  no other training exists to take you from being a regular dba to running and leading an enterprise database effort.  and don’t fool yourself;  there is a real difference.  get ready to take your skills and your career to the next level. in addition to this training, we have decided to offer all of the enterprise dba precon attendees a free copy of the dba roadmap webinar! which means, of course, that the precon pays for itself…or you get both for 50% off, or however you want to look at it. bottom line: attend sean’s precon, learn massive amounts of stuff, and improve your career exponentially. win-win-win. speaker bio: sean mccown is a microsoft certified master in sql server 2008. he is also a sql server mvp with over 15yrs experience in databases. sean is also founder and co-owner of the renowned website midnightdba.com where he records free sql server training videos and co-hosts the popular webshow, dbas@midnight.',\n",

       " '  natural building internship, feb 25 – march 24 come join us for panya’s most exciting and intricate adobe building project yet.  building the new sala!  dates: monday february 25th – sunday march 24th four weeks of intensive adobe building!   this four-week program is designed to give participants: 1) an extensive hands on experience with adobe building, natural plasters, and the building process in general,  2) an integrated experience living at an intentional community,  3) an experience of living at an integrated permaculture site.   building the new sala: this adobe building will be panya’s most ambitious effort yet.  the “sala” is the main structure at panya.  it serves as classroom, dining hall, yoga studio, dance hall, meditation area, library, office and general community center.  the new design (see the simple sketch-up drawing, without roof structure) for the sala is to build the structure as a two story, double brick wide adobe building with and really nicely finished room upstairs that will function as the office and library.  downstairs will be two distinct large rooms that each will have multiple functions, but will primarily be the 1) teaching space, and 2) the dining space.  the teaching space will have high ceilings and a loft that looks down over it. there will be plenty of built in shelving and cabinetry so serve the teaching function. the dining space will have beautiful entrances to the outdoors toward the kitchen, the garden and the residential area.  this new building is an important and exciting step for the panya community.  the community was able to raise over $10,000 in a fundraiser to help make this building all it could be. we are bringing in a crew of experienced builders to help with various aspects of the project, so interns will have the opportunity to work with a number of different builders from a wide range of building backgrounds. we are hosting two one-month internships for this building process, as we expect the construction to last multiple months.  the first internship (jan 14 – feb 10) will be focused primarily on adobe brick building:  making bricks stacking bricks making mortor building arches installing doors and windows  these are the topics that will naturally come up in that phase of the building process.  to give a more well rounded program, interns will be given an introduction to a number of other topics, most likely working on other building on sites, including:  history of natural building the foundations and fundamentals of natural building the various types of natural building the building process plasters and natural paints  the second one-month internship will be focused more the finish work of building, trying to get the sala to look the best it can.  its focus areas will include:  plastering and natural paints wiring the sala for electricity (including 12v dc solar) finishing the doors and windows planing, sanding, and fine-tuning  these are the topics that will naturally come up in that phase of the building process, and we will be very much at the mercy of the building process as to what we are doing during this section.  to give a more well rounded program, interns will be given an introduction to a number of other topics as well, including:  history of natural building the foundations and fundamentals of natural building the various types of natural building the building process making adobe bricks making mortar laying bricks installing windows, doors and other features.  each internship will have its own focus areas, and will flow with what is needed for the building project, but the instructors are also committed to make sure that interns get experience in a number of different areas of natural building. community living: at the panya project we involve all present in the daily activities that keep a community rolling, from cooking and cleaning to feeding the animals and watering the garden. we value the opportunity to share what skills we have and to learn from all present.  during this four-week internship, we will enjoy a healthy and balanced diet, intellectual stimulation, plenty of physical work, as well as time each evening to socialize, play music or take time for one’s self. the schedule for each day includes a morning work session, followed by lunch and a mid-day siesta and an afternoon work session. there will be two days of rest each week to help recharge the batteries for continued work. three vegetarian meals per day will be provided. the evenings are an opportunity for us to socialize, watch videos & slide shows, have a potluck with neighbouring communities, or squeeze in another lesson or “skill share” activity.   permaculture design: the panya project has been greatly influenced by the design principals of permaculture. we started our project about five years ago by hosting a permaculture design course, which concluded with an integrated permaculture design for our property. since then we have been working towards achieving the aims of that design, including earthen buildings, an edible food forest, a large kitchen garden and a broad acreage of fruit crops. we have also put in an extensive water harvesting swale system to help us return water to the watershed.  during your time here you will be exposed to the principles and underlying ethics of permaculture. this is a great opportunity to get a taste for what it is all about. we also have a large kitchen garden which we are working on expanding. our hope is to continue to produce a higher percentage of our own food each year. participants will have the opportunity to take part in the happenins of garden the garden if they are interested.  there are community members working with the garden that you are welcome to work with if you have that desire.  the instructors of the internship will be focused almost exclusively on building, but the friendly folks of panya would most likely be happy to have you help in the gardens if you like. in addition to all of these things, we have an a reservoir an easy 15 minute walk away for cooling off and swimming in at the end of each day, a beautiful forest around us, and two more wonderful communities next door, including a thai cooking school and café that serves the best fruit shakes in thailand. come and join us for these four weeks; we would love to have you.  there is a possibility that you could stay on afterward as a volunteer, depending on space and other course scheduling.   ---------------- costs:  4 week
